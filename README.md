# PiBot
Code Repo for SouthEastCon 2016 Robot
Rules - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITIsL9fpTk5HKEJW1NENVrkgfCgXqONWpm0sevzeYmo/edit

The robot will be using the following main components:
	Raspberry Pi 2 (Running Raspbian) - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/
	CMU Camera 5 (Pixy) - http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5/wiki
	RoboClaw 2x15a Controller - https://www.servocity.com/html/roboclaw_2x15a_motor_controlle.html#.VfBm27SppJE

The Camera and Motor Controller both have Python Libraries, and we have verified the Motor Controller is functional.
We are still validating the CMU Camera. 

The main structure of the robot code has not been decided, and many things on this page may change. Additional Components
such as screens will also be added in the future.

Please Note this Page is a WIP and will change.
